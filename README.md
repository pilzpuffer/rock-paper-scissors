# rock-paper-scissors

I've completed this project as the "foundations" part of the TOP course - this is the first JS-based project of such scope within the course.

To make my game a bit more "unusual", I've decided to flavor the text as if we're dueling the computer :)

Later on, I will return to this project and improve it, as intended by TOP.

As expected, I've returned to this project as part of the "Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors" lesson in the Foundations part of the TOP course.

Even though this wasn't required, I've worked quite a bit on the design of this site and implemented a few funny features.

This allowed me to practice with objects (as they were the optimal way of implementing many things within this "game")

Sadly, I had less free time to work on this project this week, but I've finally managed to complete it to the desired state.

At first I was going to submit it earlier, as the idea for clickable knights with sets of phrases showing according to the clicked place appeared to be a bit more advanced, based on a cursory search - as I was suggested to use the getBoundingClientRect() method which is really advanced.

But then I've thought of simply adding a few invisible buttons on top of those images - and that works like a charm! :)

Maybe that solution is not the most elegant/"smart", but hey, it works? 

Overall, I'm very happy with the end result of this project. If I were to return to it, I'd work on its scaling more to make it mobile-friendly - I don't think I want to implement any additional features here (at least not at the moment), so CSS would be the only thing I'd improve
