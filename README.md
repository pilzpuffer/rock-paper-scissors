# rock-paper-scissors

I've completed this project as the "foundations" part of the TOP course - this is the first JS-based project of such scope within the course.

To make my game a bit more "unusual", I've decided to flavor the text as if we're dueling the computer :)

Later on, I will return to this project and improve it, as intended by TOP. 

UPDATE: 03/02/2025 

As expected, I've returned to this project as part of the "Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors" lesson in the Foundations part of the TOP course.

Even though this wasn't required, I've worked quite a bit on the design of this site and implemented a few funny features.

This allowed me to practice with objects (as they were the optimal way of implementing many things within this "game")
