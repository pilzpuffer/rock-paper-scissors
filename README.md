# rock-paper-scissors

I've completed this project as the "foundations" part of the TOP course - this is the first JS-based project of such scope within the course.

To make my game a bit more "unusual", I've decided to flavor the text as if we're dueling the computer :)

Later on, I will return to this project and improve it, as intended by TOP.
